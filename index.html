                        <p>Founded in the late 90's by Vector von an italian national, the pizza place then known as 
                        La Pizza, was located in the city of Nairobi taking up the entire place
                        complex building owned by the kenyan government. Over the years, they 
                        ammased quite a tangible customer base attracting tourists from all walks 
                        of the world to taste their traditional pizza recipes, needless to say gaining quite some numbers in terms of 
                        money, buying out the whole place complex from the government and rebranding
                        themselves to Pizza Place.
